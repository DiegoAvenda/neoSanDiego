		In a dystopian future, in the year 2100, the world has been rebuilt and reformed after the third
		world war, which culminated in a nuclear disaster that devastated much of the planet. The old
		countries had been disintegrated and the new states-cities of Tokyo, Hong Kong, New York and Neo
		Diego rule the world. The latter, formerly known as San Diego, is the most powerful of all. Neo
		Diego is controlled by the mafia, the mega-corporations and the corrupt government. The poor
		population is exploited by these three figures who compete for power. Their only hope lies with
		a private detective, a group of cyberpunks, a police detective, and a mysterious vigilante
		biker. Together they will have to unravel a mystery that is unleashed after the disappearance of
		an engineer from the most important mega-corporation. If it is not done in time, the
		consequences for the city could be catastrophic.
