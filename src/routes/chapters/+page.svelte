		In a dystopian future, in the year 2100, the world has been rebuilt after the third world war,
		which culminated in a nuclear disaster that devastated much of the planet. The old countries had
		been disintegrated and the new states-cities of Tokyo, Hong Kong, New York and Neo Diego rule
		the world. The latter, formerly known as San Diego, is the most powerful of all. Neo Diego is
		controlled by the mafias, the mega-corporations and the corrupt government. The poor population
		is exploited by these three figures who compete for power. Their only hope lies with a private
		detective, a group of cyberpunks, a police detective, and a mysterious vigilante biker. Together
		they will have to unravel a mystery that is unleashed after the disappearance of an scientist
		from the most important mega-corporation. If they don't do it on time, the consequences for the
		city could be catastrophic.
